            </li>
            <li>Add config.preload_frameworks to load all frameworks at startup. Default to
            false so <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> autoloads

            turned on by config.threadsafe! [Jeremy Kemper]

            <li>Added rake rails:update:application_controller to renamed application.rb to
            application_controller.rb &#8212; included in rake rails:update so

            </li>
            <li>Added <a
            href="../../../../classes/Rails.html#M002673">Rails.backtrace_cleaner</a>
            as an accessor for the Rails::BacktraceCleaner instance used by the
            framework to cut down on backtrace noise and
            config/initializers/backtrace_silencers.rb to add your own (or turn them
            all off) [David Heinemeier Hansson]

            </li>
            <li>Added config.i18n settings gatherer to config/environment, auto-loading of

            </li>
            <li>BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE: Renamed application.rb to application_controller.rb
            and removed all the special casing that was in place to support the former.
            You must do this rename in your own application when you upgrade to this
            version [David Heinemeier Hansson]

            <li>Changed all generated tests to use the test/do declaration style [David

            <p>
            You can get around this setting per plugin. If reload_plugins? == false

            <pre>spawner               # starts instances on 8000, 8001, and 8002 using Mongrel if available&#x000A;spawner fcgi          # starts instances on 8000, 8001, and 8002 using FCGI&#x000A;spawner mongrel -i 5  # starts instances on 8000, 8001, 8002, 8003, and 8004 using Mongrel&#x000A;spawner -p 9100 -i 10 # starts 10 instances counting from 9100 to 9109 using Mongrel if available&#x000A;spawner -p 9100 -r 5  # starts 3 instances counting from 9100 to 9102 and attempts start them every 5 seconds</pre>
            <p>
            Also note that script/process/reaper is Mongrel capable. So the combination
            of spawner and reaper is a built-in alternative to something like
            mongrel_cluster.

            be the default choice if installed, otherwise FCGI is tried [David
            Heinemeier Hansson]. Examples:
            
            <pre>spawner               # starts instances on 8000, 8001, and 8002 using Mongrel if available&#x000A;spawner fcgi          # starts instances on 8000, 8001, and 8002 using FCGI&#x000A;spawner mongrel -i 5  # starts instances on 8000, 8001, 8002, 8003, and 8004 using Mongrel&#x000A;spawner -p 9100 -i 10 # starts 10 instances counting from 9100 to 9109 using Mongrel if available&#x000A;spawner -p 9100 -r 5  # starts 3 instances counting from 9100 to 9102 and attempts start them every 5 seconds</pre>
            <p>
            Also note that script/process/reaper is Mongrel capable. So the combination
            of spawner and reaper is a built-in alternative to something like
            mongrel_cluster.

            </li>
            <li>Added namespaces to all tasks, so for example load_fixtures is now
            db:fixtures:load. All the old task names are still valid, they just point

            </li>
            <li>CHANGED DEFAULT: <a
            href="../../../../classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#M002549">ActiveRecord::Base.schema_format</a>
            is now :ruby by default instead of :sql. This means that we&#8217;ll assume
            you want to live in the world of db/schema.rb where the grass is green and
            the girls are pretty. If your schema contains un-dumpable elements, such as
            constraints or database-specific column types, you just got an invitation
            to either 1) patch the dumper to include foreign key support, 2) stop being
            db specific, or 3) just change the default in config/environment.rb to
            config.active_record.schema_format = :sql &#8212; we even include an
            example for that on new <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>

            </li>
            <li>Added -r/&#8212;repeat option to script/process/spawner that offers the
            same loop protection as the spinner did. This deprecates the
            script/process/spinner, so it&#8217;s no longer included in the default <a

            <li>Added collision option to template generation in generators 3329

            <pre>m.template &quot;stuff.config&quot; , &quot;config/stuff.config&quot; , :collision =&gt; :skip&#x000A;m.template &quot;auto-stamping&quot;, &quot;config/generator.log&quot;, :collision =&gt; :force</pre>

            <li>Changed the default configuration for lighttpd to use tmp/sockets instead
            of log/ for the FastCGI sockets [David Heinemeier Hansson]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added a default configuration of the FileStore for fragment caching if
            tmp/cache is available, which makes action/fragment caching ready to use
            out of the box with no additional configuration [David Heinemeier Hansson]
            
            </li>
            <li>Changed the default session configuration to place sessions in
            tmp/sessions, if that directory is available, instead of /tmp (this
            essentially means a goodbye to 9/10 White Screen of Death errors and should
            have web hosting firms around the world cheering) [David Heinemeier
            Hansson]
            
            </li>

            Heinemeier Hansson]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added that script/generate model will now automatically create a migration
            file for the model created. This can be turned off by calling the generator
            with &#8212;skip-migration [David Heinemeier Hansson]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added -d/&#8212;database option to the rails command, so you can do
            &#8220;rails &#8212;database=sqlite2 myapp&#8221; to start a new
            application preconfigured to use SQLite2 as the database. Removed the
            configuration examples from SQLite and PostgreSQL from the default MySQL
            configuration [David Heinemeier Hansson]
            
            </li>
            <li>Allow script/server -c /path/to/lighttpd.conf [Jeremy Kemper]

            <li>Remove hardcoded path to reaper script in script/server [Jeremy Kemper]
            
            </li>
            <li>Update script.aculo.us to V1.5.3 [Thomas Fuchs]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added SIGTRAP signal handler to <a
            href="../../../../classes/RailsFCGIHandler.html">RailsFCGIHandler</a>
            that&#8217;ll force the process into a breakpoint after the next request.
            This breakpoint can then be caught with script/breakpointer and give you
            access to the Ruby image inside that process. Useful for debugging memory
            leaks among other things [David Heinemeier Hansson]
            
            </li>
            <li>Changed default lighttpd.conf to use CWD from lighttpd 1.4.10 that allows
            the same configuration to be used for both detach and not. Also ensured
            that auto-repeaping of FCGIs only happens when lighttpd is not detached.
            [David Heinemeier Hansson]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added Configuration#after_initialize for registering a block which gets
            called after the framework is fully initialized. Useful for things like
            per-environment configuration of plugins. [Michael Koziarski]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added check for RAILS_FRAMEWORK_ROOT constant that allows the <a
            href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> framework to be found in a
            different place than vendor/rails. Should be set in boot.rb. [David

            Johnson]

            <li>Added convenience controls for FCGI processes (especially when managed

            </li>
            <li>Added load_fixtures task to the Rakefile, which will load all the fixtures
            into the database for the current environment 1791 [Marcel Molina Jr.]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added an empty robots.txt to public/, so that web servers asking for it

            Schubert]
            
            </li>
            <li>Dropped the &#8216;immediate close-down&#8217; of FCGI processes since it
            didn&#8217;t work consistently and produced bad responses when it
            didn&#8217;t. So now a TERM ensures exit after the next request (just as if
            the process is handling a request when it receives the signal). This means
            that you&#8217;ll have to &#8216;nudge&#8217; all FCGI processes with a
            request in order to ensure that they have all reloaded. This can be done by
            something like ./script/process/repear &#8212;nudge &#8216;<a
            href="http://www.myapp.com">www.myapp.com</a>&#8217; &#8212;instances 10,
            which will load the myapp site 10 times (and thus hit all of the 10 FCGI
            processes once, enough to shut down).

            <ul>
            <li>Look for app-specific generators in RAILS_ROOT/generators rather than the
            clunky old RAILS_ROOT/script/generators. Nobody really uses this feature
            except for the unit tests, so it&#8217;s a negligible-impact change. If you
            want to work with third-party generators, drop them in ~/.rails/generators
            or simply install gems.

            <li>Added support for SQL Server in the database rake tasks 1652 [Ken Barker]
            Note: osql and scptxfr may need to be installed on your development
            environment. This involves getting the .exes and a .rll (scptxfr) from a
            production SQL Server (not developer level SQL Server). Add their location
            to your Environment PATH and you are all set.
            
            </li>
            <li>Added a VERSION parameter to the migrate task that allows you to do

            <ul>
            <li>Changed the default logging level in config/environment.rb to INFO for

            migrations from db/migrate
            
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>Add the option to manually manage garbage collection in the FastCGI

            </li>
            <li>Allow dynamic application reloading for dispatch.fcgi processes by sending
            a SIGHUP. If the process is currently handling a request, the request will
            be allowed to complete first. This allows production fcgi&#8217;s to be
            reloaded without having to restart them.
            
            </li>
            <li><a href="../../../../classes/RailsFCGIHandler.html">RailsFCGIHandler</a>

            </li>
            <li>Added a &#8216;whiny nil&#8217; that&#8217;s aim to ensure that when users
            pass nil to methods where that isn&#8217;t appropriate, instead of
            NoMethodError? and the name of some method used by the framework users will
            see a message explaining what type of object was expected. Only active in
            test and development environments by default 1209 [Michael Koziarski]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed the test_helper.rb to be safe for requiring controllers from multiple
            spots, like app/controllers/article_controller.rb and
            app/controllers/admin/article_controller.rb, without reloading the
            environment twice 1390 [Nicholas Seckar]

            <li>Fixed Webrick to escape + characters in URL&#8217;s the same way that

            </li>
            <li>Modernize the scaffold generator to use the simplified render and test

            </li>
            <li>Allow graceful exits for dispatch.fcgi processes by sending a SIGUSR1. If
            the process is currently handling a request, the request will be allowed to
            complete and then will terminate itself. If a request is not being handled,
            the process is terminated immediately (via exit). This basically works like
            restart graceful on Apache. [Jamis Buck]
            
            </li>
            <li>Made dispatch.fcgi more robust by catching fluke errors and retrying unless

            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Fixed dependency reloading by switching to a remove_const approach where
            all Active Records, Active Record Observers, and Action Controllers are
            reloading by undefining their classes. This enables you to remove methods
            in all three types and see the change reflected immediately and it fixes
            539. This also means that only those three types of classes will benefit
            from the const_missing and reloading approach. If you want other classes
            (like some in lib/) to reload, you must use require_dependency to do it.

            the framework to automatically pick up on
            app/views/layouts/application.rhtml and app/helpers/application.rb

            <li>Added script/console that makes it even easier to start an IRB session for
            interacting with the domain model. Run with no-args to see help.
            
            </li>
            <li>Added breakpoint support through the script/breakpointer client. This means
            that you can break out of execution at any point in the code, investigate
            and change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:
            
            <pre>class WeblogController &lt; ActionController::Base&#x000A;  def index&#x000A;    @posts = Post.find_all&#x000A;    breakpoint &quot;Breaking out from the list&quot;&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end</pre>
            <p>
            So the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present
            you with a IRB prompt in the breakpointer window. Here you can do things
            like:
            </p>
            <p>
            Executing breakpoint &#8220;Breaking out from the list&#8221; at
            &#8230;/webrick_server.rb:16 in &#8216;breakpoint&#8217;
            </p>
            <pre>&gt;&gt; @posts.inspect&#x000A;=&gt; &quot;[#&lt;Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\&quot;title\&quot;=&gt;nil, \&quot;body\&quot;=&gt;nil, \&quot;id\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;1\&quot;}&gt;,&#x000A;     #&lt;Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\&quot;title\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;Rails you know!\&quot;, \&quot;body\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;Only ten..\&quot;, \&quot;id\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;2\&quot;}&gt;]&quot;&#x000A;&gt;&gt; @posts.first.title = &quot;hello from a breakpoint&quot;&#x000A;=&gt; &quot;hello from a breakpoint&quot;</pre>
            <p>
            &#8230;and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects
            actually work:
            </p>
            <pre>&gt;&gt; f = @posts.first&#x000A;=&gt; #&lt;Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={&quot;title&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;body&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;id&quot;=&gt;&quot;1&quot;}&gt;&#x000A;&gt;&gt; f.&#x000A;Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)</pre>
            <p>
            Finally, when you&#8217;re ready to resume execution, you press CTRL-D
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>Changed environments to be configurable through an environment variable. By
            default, the environment is &#8220;development&#8221;, but you can change
            that and set your own by configuring the Apache vhost with a string like
            (mod_env must be available on the server):
            
            <pre>SetEnv RAILS_ENV production</pre>
            <p>
            &#8230;if you&#8217;re using WEBrick, you can pick the environment to use
            with the command-line parameters -e/&#8212;environment, like this:
            </p>
            <pre>ruby public/dispatcher.servlet -e production</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added a new default environment called &#8220;development&#8221;, which
            leaves the production environment to be tuned exclusively for that.

            <li>Fixed public/.htaccess to use RewriteBase and share the same rewrite rules
            for all the dispatch methods
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed webrick_server to handle requests in a serialized manner (the <a
            href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> reloading infrastructure is
            not thread-safe)
            
            </li>
            <li>Added support for controllers in directories. So you can have:
            
            <pre>app/controllers/account_controller.rb        # URL: /account/&#x000A;app/controllers/admin/account_controller.rb  # URL: /admin/account/</pre>
            <p>
            NOTE: You need to update your public/.htaccess with the new rules to pick
            it up
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>Added reloading for associations and dependencies under cached environments
            like FastCGI and mod_ruby. This makes it possible to use those environments
            for development. This is turned on by default, but can be turned off with
            ActiveRecord::Base.reload_associations = false and
            ActionController::Base.reload_dependencies = false in production
            environments.
            
            </li>
            <li>Added support for sub-directories in app/models. So now you can have
            something like Basecamp with:
            
            <pre>app/models/accounting&#x000A;app/models/project&#x000A;app/models/participants&#x000A;app/models/settings</pre>
            <p>
            It&#8217;s poor man&#8217;s namespacing, but only for file-system
            organization. You still require files just like before. Nothing changes
            inside the files themselves.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>Fixed a few references in the tests generated by new_mailer [Jeremy Kemper]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added support for mocks in testing with test/mocks
            
            </li>
            <li>Cleaned up the environments a bit and added global constant RAILS_ROOT

            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Made dev-util available to all tests, so you can insert breakpoints in any
            test case to get an IRB prompt at that point [Jeremy Kemper]:
            
            <pre>def test_complex_stuff&#x000A;  @david.projects &lt;&lt; @new_project&#x000A;  breakpoint &quot;Let's have a closer look at @david&quot;&#x000A;end</pre>
            <p>
            You need to install dev-utils yourself for this to work (&#8220;gem install
            dev-util&#8221;).

            </li>
            <li>Added shared generator behavior so future upgrades should be possible
            without manually copying over files [Jeremy Kemper]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added the new helper style to both controller and helper templates [Jeremy
            Kemper]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added new_crud generator for creating a model and controller at the same
            time with explicit scaffolding [Jeremy Kemper]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added configuration of Test::Unit::TestCase.fixture_path to test_helper to
            concide with the new AR fixtures style
            
            </li>

            <ul>
            <li>Removed custom_table_name option for new_model now that the Inflector is as
            powerful as it is
            
            </li>
            <li>Changed the default rake action to just do testing and separate API
            generation and coding statistics into a &#8220;doc&#8221; task.
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed WEBrick dispatcher to handle missing slashes in the URLs gracefully
            [alexey]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added user option for all postgresql tool calls in the rakefile [elvstone]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed problem with running &#8220;ruby public/dispatch.servlet&#8220;
            instead of &#8220;cd public; ruby dispatch.servlet&#8220; [alexey]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed WEBrick server so that it no longer hardcodes the ruby interpreter
            used to &#8220;ruby&#8221; but will get the one used based on the Ruby
            runtime configuration. [Marcel Molina Jr.]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed Dispatcher so it&#8217;ll route requests to magic_beans to
            MagicBeansController/magic_beans_controller.rb [Caio Chassot]
            
            </li>
            <li>&#8220;new_controller MagicBeans&#8221; and &#8220;new_model
            SubscriptionPayments&#8221; will now both behave properly as they use the
            new Inflector.
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed problem with MySQL foreign key constraint checks in Rake
            :clone_production_structure_to_test target [Andreas Schwarz]
            
            </li>
            <li>Changed WEBrick server to by default be auto-reloading, which is slower but
            makes source changes instant. Class compilation cache can be turned on with
            &#8220;-c&#8221; or &#8220;&#8212;cache-classes&#8221;.
            
            </li>
            <li>Added &#8220;-b/&#8212;binding&#8221; option to WEBrick dispatcher to bind
            the server to a specific IP address (default: 127.0.0.1) [Kevin Temp]
            
            </li>
            <li>dispatch.fcgi now DOESN&#8217;T set FCGI_PURE_RUBY as it was slowing things
            down for now reason [Andreas Schwarz]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added new_mailer generator to work with Action Mailer
            
            </li>
            <li>Included new framework: Action Mailer 0.3
            
            </li>
            <li>Upgraded to Action Pack 0.9.0

            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Added an optional second argument to the new_model script that allows the
            programmer to specify the table name, which will used to generate a custom
            table_name method in the model and will also be used in the creation of
            fixtures. [Kevin Radloff]
            
            </li>
            <li>script/new_model now turns AccountHolder into account_holder instead of
            accountholder [Kevin Radloff]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed the faulty handleing of static files with WEBrick [Andreas Schwarz]
            
            </li>
            <li>Unified function_test_helper and unit_test_helper into test_helper
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed bug with the automated production => test database dropping on
            PostgreSQL [dhawkins]
            
            </li>
            <li>create_fixtures in both the functional and unit test helper now turns off
            the log during fixture generation and can generate more than one fixture at
            a time. Which makes it possible for assignments like:
            
            <pre>@people, @projects, @project_access, @companies, @accounts =&#x000A;  create_fixtures &quot;people&quot;, &quot;projects&quot;, &quot;project_access&quot;, &quot;companies&quot;, &quot;accounts&quot;</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Upgraded to Action Pack 0.8.5 (locally-scoped variables, partials, advanced
            send_file)
            
            </li>
            <li>Upgraded to Active Record 0.9.5 (better table_name guessing, cloning,
            find_all_in_collection)
            
            </li>
            </ul>

            <b>0.6.5</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>No longer specifies a template for rdoc, so it&#8217;ll use whatever is
            default (you can change it in the rakefile)
            
            </li>
            <li>The new_model generator will now use the same rules for plural wordings as
            Active Record (so Category will give categories, not categorys) [Kevin
            Radloff]
            
            </li>
            <li>dispatch.fcgi now sets FCGI_PURE_RUBY to true to ensure that it&#8217;s the
            Ruby version that&#8217;s loaded [danp]
            
            </li>
            <li>Made the GEM work with Windows
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed bug where mod_ruby would &#8220;forget&#8221; the load paths added
            when switching between controllers
            
            </li>
            <li>PostgreSQL are now supported for the automated production => test database
            dropping [Kevin Radloff]
            
            </li>
            <li>Errors thrown by the dispatcher are now properly handled in FCGI.
            
            </li>
            <li>Upgraded to Action Pack 0.8.0 (lots and lots and lots of fixes)
            
            </li>
            <li>Upgraded to Active Record 0.9.4 (a bunch of fixes)

            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Added AbstractionApplicationController as a superclass for all controllers
            generated. This class can be used to carry filters and methods that are to
            be shared by all. It has an accompanying ApplicationHelper that all
            controllers will also automatically have available.
            
            </li>
            <li>Added environments that can be included from any script to get the full
            Active Record and Action Controller context running. This can be used by
            maintenance scripts or to interact with the model through IRB. Example:
            
            <pre>require 'config/environments/production'&#x000A;&#x000A;for account in Account.find_all&#x000A;  account.recalculate_interests&#x000A;end</pre>
            <p>
            A short migration script for an account model that had it&#8217;s interest
            calculation strategy changed.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>Accessing the index of a controller with &#8220;/weblog&#8221; will now
            redirect to &#8220;/weblog/&#8221; (only on Apache, not WEBrick)
            
            </li>
            <li>Simplified the default Apache config so even remote requests are served off
            CGI as a default. You&#8217;ll now have to do something specific to
            activate mod_ruby and FCGI (like using the force urls). This should make it
            easier for new comers that start on an external server.
            
            </li>
            <li>Added more of the necessary Apache options to .htaccess to make it easier
            to setup
            
            </li>
            <li>Upgraded to Action Pack 0.7.9 (lots of fixes)

            </li>
            <li>Added lib in root as a place to store app specific libraries
            
            </li>
            <li>Added lib and vendor to load_path, so anything store within can be loaded
            directly. Hence lib/redcloth.rb can be loaded with require
