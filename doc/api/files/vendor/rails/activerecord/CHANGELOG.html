            <p>
            This is rarely used directly, but allows for find_or_create on

            create the record if it doesn&#8217;t already exist [David Heinemeier

            <pre># No 'Summer' tag exists&#x000A;Tag.find_or_create_by_name(&quot;Summer&quot;) # equal to Tag.create(:name =&gt; &quot;Summer&quot;)&#x000A;&#x000A;# Now the 'Summer' tag does exist&#x000A;Tag.find_or_create_by_name(&quot;Summer&quot;) # equal to Tag.find_by_name(&quot;Summer&quot;)</pre>

            current implementation is fairly limited &#8212; only tables and sequences
            are cloned, not constraints or indexes. A full clone in Oracle generally
            requires some manual effort, and is version-specific. Post 9i, Oracle
            recommends the use of the DBMS_METADATA package, though that approach
            requires editing of the physical characteristics generated 1798

            NOTICE: This patch changes the underlying SQL generated by
            has_and_belongs_to_many queries. If your relying on that, such as by
            explicitly referencing the old t and j aliases, you&#8217;ll need to update
            your code. Of course, you _shouldn&#8217;t_ be relying on details like that
            no less than you should be diving in to touch private variables. But just
            in case you do, consider yourself noticed :)

            1324 [Duane Johnson/jhosteny]. Examples:
            
            <p>
            Conditional validations such as the following are made possible:
            </p>
            <pre>validates_numericality_of :income, :if =&gt; :employed?</pre>
            <p>
            Conditional validations can also solve the salted login generator problem:
            </p>
            <pre>validates_confirmation_of :password, :if =&gt; :new_password?</pre>
            <p>
            Using blocks:
            </p>
            <pre>validates_presence_of :username, :if =&gt; Proc.new { |user| user.signup_step &gt; 1 }</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Fixed use of construct_finder_sql when using :join 1288 [dwlt@dwlt.net]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that :delete_sql in has_and_belongs_to_many associations
            couldn&#8217;t access record properties 1299 [Rick Olson]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that clone would break when an aggregate had the same name as one of
            its attributes 1307 [Jeremy Kemper]
            
            </li>
            <li>Changed that destroying an object will only freeze the attributes hash,
            which keeps the object from having attributes changed (as that
            wouldn&#8217;t make sense), but allows for the querying of associations
            after it has been destroyed.
            
            </li>
            <li>Changed the callbacks such that observers are notified before the in-object
            callbacks are triggered. Without this change, it wasn&#8217;t possible to
            act on the whole object in something like a before_destroy observer without
            having the objects own callbacks (like deleting associations) called first.
            
            </li>
            <li>Added option for passing an array to the find_all version of the dynamic
            finders and have it evaluated as an IN fragment. Example:
            
            <pre># SELECT * FROM topics WHERE title IN ('First', 'Second')&#x000A;Topic.find_all_by_title([&quot;First&quot;, &quot;Second&quot;])</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added compatibility with camelCase column names for dynamic finders 533
            [Dee Zsombor]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed extraneous comma in count() function that made it not work with joins
            1156 [Jarkko Laine/Dee Zsombor]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed incompatibility with Base#find with an array of ids that would fail
            when using eager loading 1186 [Alisdair McDiarmid]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that validate_length_of lost :on option when :within was specified
            1195 [jhosteny@mac.com]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added encoding and min_messages options for PostgreSQL 1205 [Shugo Maeda].
            Configuration example:
            
            <pre>development:&#x000A;  adapter: postgresql&#x000A;  database: rails_development&#x000A;  host: localhost&#x000A;  username: postgres&#x000A;  password:&#x000A;  encoding: UTF8&#x000A;  min_messages: ERROR</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Fixed acts_as_list where deleting an item that was removed from the list
            would ruin the positioning of other list items 1197 [Jamis Buck]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added validates_exclusion_of as a negative of validates_inclusion_of
            
            </li>
            <li>Optimized counting of has_many associations by setting the association to
            empty if the count is 0 so repeated calls doesn&#8217;t trigger database
            calls
            
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            <b>1.10.1</b> (20th April, 2005)
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Fixed frivilous database queries being triggered with eager loading on
            empty associations and other things
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed order of loading in eager associations
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed stray comma when using eager loading and ordering together from
            has_many associations 1143
            
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            <b>1.10.0</b> (19th April, 2005)
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Added eager loading of associations as a way to solve the N+1 problem more
            gracefully without piggy-back queries. Example:
            
            <pre>for post in Post.find(:all, :limit =&gt; 100)&#x000A;  puts &quot;Post:            &quot; + post.title&#x000A;  puts &quot;Written by:      &quot; + post.author.name&#x000A;  puts &quot;Last comment on: &quot; + post.comments.first.created_on&#x000A;end</pre>
            <p>
            This used to generate 301 database queries if all 100 posts had both author
            and comments. It can now be written as:
            </p>
            <pre>for post in Post.find(:all, :limit =&gt; 100, :include =&gt; [ :author, :comments ])</pre>
            <p>
            &#8230;and the number of database queries needed is now 1.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>Added new unified Base.find API and deprecated the use of find_first and
            find_all. See the documentation for Base.find. Examples:
            
            <pre>Person.find(1, :conditions =&gt; &quot;administrator = 1&quot;, :order =&gt; &quot;created_on DESC&quot;)&#x000A;Person.find(1, 5, 6, :conditions =&gt; &quot;administrator = 1&quot;, :order =&gt; &quot;created_on DESC&quot;)&#x000A;Person.find(:first, :order =&gt; &quot;created_on DESC&quot;, :offset =&gt; 5)&#x000A;Person.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; [ &quot;category IN (?)&quot;, categories], :limit =&gt; 50)&#x000A;Person.find(:all, :offset =&gt; 10, :limit =&gt; 10)</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added acts_as_nested_set 1000 [wschenk]. Introduction:
            
            <pre>This acts provides Nested Set functionality.  Nested Set is similiar to Tree, but with&#x000A;the added feature that you can select the children and all of it's descendants with&#x000A;a single query.  A good use case for this is a threaded post system, where you want&#x000A;to display every reply to a comment without multiple selects.</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added Base.save! that attempts to save the record just like Base.save but
            will raise a RecordInvalid exception instead of returning false if the
            record is not valid [Dave Thomas]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed PostgreSQL usage of fixtures with regards to public schemas and table
            names with dots 962 [gnuman1@gmail.com]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that fixtures were being deleted in the same order as inserts causing
            FK errors 890 [andrew.john.peters@gmail.com]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed loading of fixtures in to be in the right order (or PostgreSQL would
            bark) 1047 [stephenh@chase3000.com]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed page caching for non-vhost applications living underneath the root
            1004 [Ben Schumacher]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixes a problem with the SQL Adapter which was resulting in IDENTITY_INSERT
            not being set to ON when it should be 1104 [adelle]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added the option to specify the acceptance string in
            validates_acceptance_of 1106 [caleb@aei-tech.com]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added insert_at(position) to acts_as_list 1083 [DeLynnB]
            
            </li>
            <li>Removed the default order by id on has_and_belongs_to_many queries as it
            could kill performance on large sets (you can still specify by hand with
            :order)
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that Base.silence should restore the old logger level when done, not
            just set it to DEBUG 1084 [yon@milliped.com]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed boolean saving on Oracle 1093 [mparrish@pearware.org]
            
            </li>
            <li>Moved build_association and create_association for has_one and belongs_to
            out of deprecation as they work when the association is nil unlike
            association.build and association.create, which require the association to
            be already in place 864
            
            </li>
            <li>Added rollbacks of transactions if they&#8217;re active as the dispatcher
            is killed gracefully (TERM signal) 1054 [Leon Bredt]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added quoting of column names for fixtures 997 [jcfischer@gmail.com]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed counter_sql when no records exist in database for PostgreSQL (would
            give error, not 0) 1039 [Caleb Tennis]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that benchmarking times for rendering included db runtimes 987
            [Stefan Kaes]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed boolean queries for t/f fields in PostgreSQL 995
            [dave@cherryville.org]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added that model.items.delete(child) will delete the child, not just set
            the foreign key to nil, if the child is dependent on the model 978 [Jeremy
            Kemper]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed auto-stamping of dates (created_on/updated_on) for PostgreSQL 985

            </li>

            </li>
            <li>Added a join parameter as the third argument to Base.find_first and as the
            second to Base.count 426, 988 [Stefan Kaes]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed bug in Base#hash method that would treat records with the same
            string-based id as different [Dave Thomas]
            
            </li>
            <li>Renamed DateHelper#distance_of_time_in_words_to_now to
            DateHelper#time_ago_in_words (old method name is still available as a
            deprecated alias)

            808
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that MissingSourceFile&#8217;s wasn&#8217;t properly detected in

            <li>Fixed that :counter_cache option would look for a line_items_count column

            </li>
            <li>Fixed that AR exists?() would explode on postgresql if the passed id did

            <li>Fixed the MS SQL adapter to work with the new limit/offset approach and

            <li>Added adapter independent limit clause as a two-element array with the
            first being the limit, the second being the offset 795 [Sam Stephenson].
            Example:

            </li>
            <li>Added validates_numericality_of 716 [Sebastian Kanthak/Chris McGrath].
            Docuemntation:
            
            <pre>Validates whether the value of the specified attribute is numeric by trying to convert it to&#x000A;a float with Kernel.Float (if &lt;tt&gt;integer&lt;/tt&gt; is false) or applying it to the regular expression&#x000A;&lt;tt&gt;/^[\+\-]?\d+$/&lt;/tt&gt; (if &lt;tt&gt;integer&lt;/tt&gt; is set to true).&#x000A;&#x000A;  class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;    validates_numericality_of :value, :on =&gt; :create&#x000A;  end&#x000A;&#x000A;Configuration options:&#x000A;* &lt;tt&gt;message&lt;/tt&gt; - A custom error message (default is: &quot;is not a number&quot;)&#x000A;* &lt;tt&gt;on&lt;/tt&gt; Specifies when this validation is active (default is :save, other options :create, :update)&#x000A;* &lt;tt&gt;only_integer&lt;/tt&gt; Specifies whether the value has to be an integer, e.g. an integral value (default is false)</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that HasManyAssociation#count was using :finder_sql rather than
            :counter_sql if it was available 445 [Scott Barron]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added better defaults for composed_of, so statements like composed_of
            :time_zone, :mapping => %w( time_zone time_zone ) can be written without
            the mapping part (it&#8217;s now assumed)
            
            </li>
            <li>Added MacroReflection#macro which will return a symbol describing the macro
            used (like :composed_of or :has_many) 718, 248 [james@slashetc.com]

            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Changed the auto-timestamping feature to use <a
            href="../../../../classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#M002548">ActiveRecord::Base.default_timezone</a>
            instead of entertaining the parallel ActiveRecord::Base.timestamps_gmt
            method. The latter is now deprecated and will throw a warning on use (but
            still work) 710 [Jamis Buck]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added a OCI8-based Oracle adapter that has been verified to work with
            Oracle 8 and 9 629 [Graham Jenkins]. Usage notes:
            
            <pre>1.  Key generation uses a sequence &quot;rails_sequence&quot; for all tables. (I couldn't find a simple&#x000A;    and safe way of passing table-specific sequence information to the adapter.)&#x000A;2.  Oracle uses DATE or TIMESTAMP datatypes for both dates and times. Consequently I have had to&#x000A;    resort to some hacks to get data converted to Date or Time in Ruby.&#x000A;    If the column_name ends in _at (like created_at, updated_at) it's created as a Ruby Time. Else if the&#x000A;    hours/minutes/seconds are 0, I make it a Ruby Date. Else it's a Ruby Time.&#x000A;    This is nasty - but if you use Duck Typing you'll probably not care very much.&#x000A;    In 9i it's tempting to map DATE to Date and TIMESTAMP to Time but I don't think that is&#x000A;    valid - too many databases use DATE for both.&#x000A;    Timezones and sub-second precision on timestamps are not supported.&#x000A;3.  Default values that are functions (such as &quot;SYSDATE&quot;) are not supported. This is a&#x000A;    restriction of the way active record supports default values.&#x000A;4.  Referential integrity constraints are not fully supported. Under at least&#x000A;    some circumstances, active record appears to delete parent and child records out of&#x000A;    sequence and out of transaction scope. (Or this may just be a problem of test setup.)</pre>

            <li>Added option :schema_order to the PostgreSQL adapter to support the use of
            multiple schemas per database 697 [YuriSchimke]
            
            </li>
            <li>Optimized the SQL used to generate has_and_belongs_to_many queries by
            listing the join table first 693 [yerejm]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that when using validation macros with a custom message, if you
            happened to use single quotes in the message string you would get a parsing
            error 657 [tonka]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that Active Record would throw Broken Pipe errors with FCGI when the
            MySQL connection timed out instead of reconnecting 428 [Nicholas Seckar]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added options to specify an SSL connection for MySQL. Define the following
            attributes in the connection config (config/database.yml in <a
            href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>) to use it: sslkey,
            sslcert, sslca, sslcapath, sslcipher. To use SSL with no client certs, just

            </li>

            [demetrius]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed the SQL Server adapter on a bunch of issues 667 [DeLynn]
            
            <pre>1. Created a new columns method that is much cleaner.&#x000A;2. Corrected a problem with the select and select_all methods&#x000A;   that didn't account for the LIMIT clause being passed into raw SQL statements.&#x000A;3. Implemented the string_to_time method in order to create proper instances of the time class.&#x000A;4. Added logic to the simplified_type method that allows the database to specify the scale of float data.&#x000A;5. Adjusted the quote_column_name to account for the fact that MS SQL is bothered by a forward slash in the data string.</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that the dynamic finder like find_all_by_something_boolean(false)
            didn&#8217;t work 649 [lmarlow]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added validates_each that validates each specified attribute against a
            block 610 [Jeremy Kemper]. Example:
            
            <pre>class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  validates_each :first_name, :last_name do |record, attr|&#x000A;    record.errors.add attr, 'starts with z.' if attr[0] == ?z&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added :allow_nil as an explicit option for validates_length_of, so unless
            that&#8217;s set to true having the attribute as nil will also return an
            error if a range is specified as :within 610 [Jeremy Kemper]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added that validates_* now accept blocks to perform validations 618 [Tim
            Bates]. Example:
            
            <pre>class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  validate { |person| person.errors.add(&quot;title&quot;, &quot;will never be valid&quot;) if SHOULD_NEVER_BE_VALID }&#x000A;end</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Addded validation for validate all the associated objects before declaring
            failure with validates_associated 618 [Tim Bates]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added keyword-style approach to defining the custom relational bindings 545
            [Jamis Buck]. Example:
            
            <pre>class Project &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  primary_key &quot;sysid&quot;&#x000A;  table_name &quot;XYZ_PROJECT&quot;&#x000A;  inheritance_column { original_inheritance_column + &quot;_id&quot; }&#x000A;end</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Fixed Base#clone for use with PostgreSQL 565 [hanson@surgery.wisc.edu]

            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Added that has_many association build and create methods can take arrays of
            record data like Base#create and Base#build to build/create multiple
            records at once.
            
            </li>
            <li>Added that Base#delete and Base#destroy both can take an array of ids to
            delete/destroy 336
            
            </li>
            <li>Added the option of supplying an array of attributes to Base#create, so
            that multiple records can be created at once.
            
            </li>
            <li>Added the option of supplying an array of ids and attributes to
            Base#update, so that multiple records can be updated at once (inspired by
            526/Duane Johnson). Example
            
            <pre>people = { 1 =&gt; { &quot;first_name&quot; =&gt; &quot;David&quot; }, 2 =&gt; { &quot;first_name&quot; =&gt; &quot;Jeremy&quot;} }&#x000A;Person.update(people.keys, people.values)</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added ActiveRecord::Base.timestamps_gmt that can be set to true to make the
            automated timestamping use GMT instead of local time 520 [Scott Baron]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added that update_all calls sanitize_sql on its updates argument, so stuff
            like MyRecord.update_all([&#8216;time = ?&#8217;, Time.now]) works 519
            [notahat]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that the dynamic finders didn&#8217;t treat nil as a &#8220;IS
            NULL&#8221; but rather &#8220;= NULL&#8221; case 515 [Demetrius]

            <li>Added bind-named arrays for interpolating a group of ids or strings in

            </li>
            <li>Added that has_and_belongs_to_many associations with additional attributes
            also can be created between unsaved objects and only committed to the
            database when Base#save is called on the associator 524 [Eric Anderson]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that records fetched with piggy-back attributes or through rich
            has_and_belongs_to_many associations couldn&#8217;t be saved due to the
            extra attributes not part of the table 522 [Eric Anderson]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added mass-assignment protection for the inheritance column &#8212;

            </li>

            &#8216;if project.manager&#8217; &#8212; this unfortunately also means that
            you can&#8217;t call methods like project.manager.build unless there

            </li>
            <li>Added validates_associated that enables validation of objects in an unsaved
            association 398 [Tim Bates]. Example:
            
            <pre>class Book &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  has_many :pages&#x000A;  belongs_to :library&#x000A;&#x000A;  validates_associated :pages, :library&#x000A;end</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added support for associating unsaved objects 402 [Tim Bates]. Rules that
            govern this addition:
            
            <pre>== Unsaved objects and associations&#x000A;&#x000A;You can manipulate objects and associations before they are saved to the database, but there is some special behaviour you should be&#x000A;aware of, mostly involving the saving of associated objects.&#x000A;&#x000A;=== One-to-one associations&#x000A;&#x000A;* Assigning an object to a has_one association automatically saves that object, and the object being replaced (if there is one), in&#x000A;  order to update their primary keys - except if the parent object is unsaved (new_record? == true).&#x000A;* If either of these saves fail (due to one of the objects being invalid) the assignment statement returns false and the assignment&#x000A;  is cancelled.&#x000A;* If you wish to assign an object to a has_one association without saving it, use the #association.build method (documented below).&#x000A;* Assigning an object to a belongs_to association does not save the object, since the foreign key field belongs on the parent. It does&#x000A;  not save the parent either.&#x000A;&#x000A;=== Collections&#x000A;&#x000A;* Adding an object to a collection (has_many or has_and_belongs_to_many) automatically saves that object, except if the parent object&#x000A;  (the owner of the collection) is not yet stored in the database.&#x000A;* If saving any of the objects being added to a collection (via #push or similar) fails, then #push returns false.&#x000A;* You can add an object to a collection without automatically saving it by using the #collection.build method (documented below).&#x000A;* All unsaved (new_record? == true) members of the collection are automatically saved when the parent is saved.</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added replace to associations, so you can do
            project.manager.replace(new_manager) or
            project.milestones.replace(new_milestones) 402 [Tim Bates]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added build and create methods to has_one and belongs_to associations, so
            you can now do project.manager.build(attributes) 402 [Tim Bates]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added that if a before_* callback returns false, all the later callbacks
            and the associated action are cancelled. If an after_* callback returns
            false, all the later callbacks are cancelled. Callbacks are generally run
            in the order they are defined, with the exception of callbacks defined as
            methods on the model, which are called last. 402 [Tim Bates]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that Base#== wouldn&#8217;t work for multiple references to the same
            unsaved object 402 [Tim Bates]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed binary support for PostgreSQL 444 [alex@byzantine.no]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added a differenciation between AssociationCollection#size and -length. Now
            AssociationCollection#size returns the size of the collection by executing
            a SELECT COUNT(*) query if the collection hasn&#8217;t been loaded and
            calling collection.size if it has. If it&#8217;s more likely than not that
            the collection does have a size larger than zero and you need to fetch that
            collection afterwards, it&#8217;ll take one less SELECT query if you use
            length.
            
            </li>
            <li>Added Base#attributes that returns a hash of all the attributes with their
            names as keys and clones of their objects as values 433 [atyp.de]
            
            </li>

            overflow 437 [Eric Anderson]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed default scope of acts_as_list from &#8220;1&#8221; to &#8220;1 =
            1&#8221;, so it&#8217;ll work in PostgreSQL (among other places) 427

            <li>Added calculations: Base.count, Base.average, Base.sum, Base.minimum,
            Base.maxmium, and the generic Base.calculate. All can be used with :group

            are cloned, not constraints or indexes. A full clone in Oracle generally
            requires some manual effort, and is version-specific. Post 9i, Oracle
            recommends the use of the DBMS_METADATA package, though that approach
            requires editing of the physical characteristics generated 1798

            NOTICE: This patch changes the underlying SQL generated by
            has_and_belongs_to_many queries. If your relying on that, such as by
            explicitly referencing the old t and j aliases, you&#8217;ll need to update
            your code. Of course, you _shouldn&#8217;t_ be relying on details like that

            association 1212
            
            </li>
            <li>Added a second parameter to the build and create method for has_one that
            controls whether the existing association should be replaced (which means
            nullifying its foreign key as well). By default this is true, but false can
            be passed to prevent it.

            <li>Using transactional fixtures now causes the data to be loaded only once.

            <li>Added fixture accessor methods that can be used when instantiated fixtures
            are disabled.
            
            <pre>fixtures :web_sites&#x000A;&#x000A;def test_something&#x000A;  assert_equal &quot;Ruby on Rails&quot;, web_sites(:rubyonrails).name&#x000A;end</pre>

            <li>Added DoubleRenderError exception that&#8217;ll be raised if render* is

            <li>CHANGED: validates_presence_of now uses Errors#add_on_blank, which will

            </li>
            <li>Added Errors#add_on_blank which works like Errors#add_on_empty, but uses <a
            href="../../../../classes/Object.html#M000281">Object#blank?</a> instead
            
            </li>
            <li>Added the :if option to all validations that can either use a block or a
            method pointer to determine whether the validation should be run or not.
            1324 [Duane Johnson/jhosteny]. Examples:
            
            <p>
            Conditional validations such as the following are made possible:
            </p>
            <pre>validates_numericality_of :income, :if =&gt; :employed?</pre>
            <p>
            Conditional validations can also solve the salted login generator problem:
            </p>
            <pre>validates_confirmation_of :password, :if =&gt; :new_password?</pre>
            <p>
            Using blocks:
            </p>
            <pre>validates_presence_of :username, :if =&gt; Proc.new { |user| user.signup_step &gt; 1 }</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Fixed use of construct_finder_sql when using :join 1288 [dwlt@dwlt.net]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that :delete_sql in has_and_belongs_to_many associations
            couldn&#8217;t access record properties 1299 [Rick Olson]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that clone would break when an aggregate had the same name as one of
            its attributes 1307 [Jeremy Kemper]
            
            </li>
            <li>Changed that destroying an object will only freeze the attributes hash,
            which keeps the object from having attributes changed (as that
            wouldn&#8217;t make sense), but allows for the querying of associations
            after it has been destroyed.
            
            </li>
            <li>Changed the callbacks such that observers are notified before the in-object
            callbacks are triggered. Without this change, it wasn&#8217;t possible to
            act on the whole object in something like a before_destroy observer without
            having the objects own callbacks (like deleting associations) called first.
            
            </li>
            <li>Added option for passing an array to the find_all version of the dynamic
            finders and have it evaluated as an IN fragment. Example:
            
            <pre># SELECT * FROM topics WHERE title IN ('First', 'Second')&#x000A;Topic.find_all_by_title([&quot;First&quot;, &quot;Second&quot;])</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added compatibility with camelCase column names for dynamic finders 533
            [Dee Zsombor]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed extraneous comma in count() function that made it not work with joins
            1156 [Jarkko Laine/Dee Zsombor]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed incompatibility with Base#find with an array of ids that would fail
            when using eager loading 1186 [Alisdair McDiarmid]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that validate_length_of lost :on option when :within was specified
            1195 [jhosteny@mac.com]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added encoding and min_messages options for PostgreSQL 1205 [Shugo Maeda].
            Configuration example:
            
            <pre>development:&#x000A;  adapter: postgresql&#x000A;  database: rails_development&#x000A;  host: localhost&#x000A;  username: postgres&#x000A;  password:&#x000A;  encoding: UTF8&#x000A;  min_messages: ERROR</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Fixed acts_as_list where deleting an item that was removed from the list
            would ruin the positioning of other list items 1197 [Jamis Buck]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added validates_exclusion_of as a negative of validates_inclusion_of
            
            </li>
            <li>Optimized counting of has_many associations by setting the association to
            empty if the count is 0 so repeated calls doesn&#8217;t trigger database
            calls
            
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            <b>1.10.1</b> (20th April, 2005)
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Fixed frivilous database queries being triggered with eager loading on
            empty associations and other things
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed order of loading in eager associations
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed stray comma when using eager loading and ordering together from
            has_many associations 1143
            
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            <b>1.10.0</b> (19th April, 2005)
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Added eager loading of associations as a way to solve the N+1 problem more
            gracefully without piggy-back queries. Example:
            
            <pre>for post in Post.find(:all, :limit =&gt; 100)&#x000A;  puts &quot;Post:            &quot; + post.title&#x000A;  puts &quot;Written by:      &quot; + post.author.name&#x000A;  puts &quot;Last comment on: &quot; + post.comments.first.created_on&#x000A;end</pre>
            <p>
            This used to generate 301 database queries if all 100 posts had both author
            and comments. It can now be written as:
            </p>
            <pre>for post in Post.find(:all, :limit =&gt; 100, :include =&gt; [ :author, :comments ])</pre>
            <p>
            &#8230;and the number of database queries needed is now 1.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>Added new unified Base.find API and deprecated the use of find_first and
            find_all. See the documentation for Base.find. Examples:
            
            <pre>Person.find(1, :conditions =&gt; &quot;administrator = 1&quot;, :order =&gt; &quot;created_on DESC&quot;)&#x000A;Person.find(1, 5, 6, :conditions =&gt; &quot;administrator = 1&quot;, :order =&gt; &quot;created_on DESC&quot;)&#x000A;Person.find(:first, :order =&gt; &quot;created_on DESC&quot;, :offset =&gt; 5)&#x000A;Person.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; [ &quot;category IN (?)&quot;, categories], :limit =&gt; 50)&#x000A;Person.find(:all, :offset =&gt; 10, :limit =&gt; 10)</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added acts_as_nested_set 1000 [wschenk]. Introduction:
            
            <pre>This acts provides Nested Set functionality.  Nested Set is similiar to Tree, but with&#x000A;the added feature that you can select the children and all of it's descendants with&#x000A;a single query.  A good use case for this is a threaded post system, where you want&#x000A;to display every reply to a comment without multiple selects.</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added Base.save! that attempts to save the record just like Base.save but
            will raise a RecordInvalid exception instead of returning false if the
            record is not valid [Dave Thomas]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed PostgreSQL usage of fixtures with regards to public schemas and table
            names with dots 962 [gnuman1@gmail.com]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that fixtures were being deleted in the same order as inserts causing
            FK errors 890 [andrew.john.peters@gmail.com]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed loading of fixtures in to be in the right order (or PostgreSQL would
            bark) 1047 [stephenh@chase3000.com]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed page caching for non-vhost applications living underneath the root
            1004 [Ben Schumacher]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixes a problem with the SQL Adapter which was resulting in IDENTITY_INSERT
            not being set to ON when it should be 1104 [adelle]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added the option to specify the acceptance string in

            </li>
            <li>Added insert_at(position) to acts_as_list 1083 [DeLynnB]
            
            </li>
            <li>Removed the default order by id on has_and_belongs_to_many queries as it
            could kill performance on large sets (you can still specify by hand with
            :order)
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that Base.silence should restore the old logger level when done, not
            just set it to DEBUG 1084 [yon@milliped.com]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed boolean saving on Oracle 1093 [mparrish@pearware.org]
            
            </li>
            <li>Moved build_association and create_association for has_one and belongs_to
            out of deprecation as they work when the association is nil unlike
            association.build and association.create, which require the association to
            be already in place 864
            
            </li>
            <li>Added rollbacks of transactions if they&#8217;re active as the dispatcher
            is killed gracefully (TERM signal) 1054 [Leon Bredt]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added quoting of column names for fixtures 997 [jcfischer@gmail.com]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed counter_sql when no records exist in database for PostgreSQL (would
            give error, not 0) 1039 [Caleb Tennis]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that benchmarking times for rendering included db runtimes 987

            </li>
            <li>Added that model.items.delete(child) will delete the child, not just set
            the foreign key to nil, if the child is dependent on the model 978 [Jeremy
            Kemper]

            <li>Added a join parameter as the third argument to Base.find_first and as the
            second to Base.count 426, 988 [Stefan Kaes]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed bug in Base#hash method that would treat records with the same
            string-based id as different [Dave Thomas]
            
            </li>
            <li>Renamed DateHelper#distance_of_time_in_words_to_now to
            DateHelper#time_ago_in_words (old method name is still available as a
            deprecated alias)

            <li>Added adapter independent limit clause as a two-element array with the
            first being the limit, the second being the offset 795 [Sam Stephenson].

            <li>Added <a
            href="../../../../classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#M002547">ActiveRecord::Base.colorize_logging</a>
            to control whether to use colors in logs or not (on by default)

            <li>Added support for timestamp with time zone in PostgreSQL 560 [Scott Barron]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added MultiparameterAssignmentErrors and AttributeAssignmentError
            exceptions 777 [demetrius]. Documentation:
            
            <pre>* +MultiparameterAssignmentErrors+ -- collection of errors that occurred during a mass assignment using the&#x000A;  +attributes=+ method. The +errors+ property of this exception contains an array of +AttributeAssignmentError+&#x000A;  objects that should be inspected to determine which attributes triggered the errors.&#x000A;* +AttributeAssignmentError+ -- an error occurred while doing a mass assignment through the +attributes=+ method.&#x000A;  You can inspect the +attribute+ property of the exception object to determine which attribute triggered the error.</pre>

            null value 771 [rodrigo k]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added transactional fixtures that uses rollback to undo changes to fixtures
            instead of DELETE/INSERT &#8212; it&#8217;s much faster. See documentation
            under <a href="../../../../classes/Fixtures.html">Fixtures</a> 760 [Jeremy
            Kemper]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added destruction of dependent objects in has_one associations when a new
            assignment happens 742 [mindel]. Example:
            
            <pre>class Account &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  has_one :credit_card, :dependent =&gt; true&#x000A;end&#x000A;class CreditCard &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  belongs_to :account&#x000A;end&#x000A;&#x000A;account.credit_card # =&gt; returns existing credit card, lets say id = 12&#x000A;account.credit_card = CreditCard.create(&quot;number&quot; =&gt; &quot;123&quot;)&#x000A;account.save # =&gt; CC with id = 12 is destroyed</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added validates_numericality_of 716 [Sebastian Kanthak/Chris McGrath].
            Docuemntation:
            
            <pre>Validates whether the value of the specified attribute is numeric by trying to convert it to&#x000A;a float with Kernel.Float (if &lt;tt&gt;integer&lt;/tt&gt; is false) or applying it to the regular expression&#x000A;&lt;tt&gt;/^[\+\-]?\d+$/&lt;/tt&gt; (if &lt;tt&gt;integer&lt;/tt&gt; is set to true).&#x000A;&#x000A;  class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;    validates_numericality_of :value, :on =&gt; :create&#x000A;  end&#x000A;&#x000A;Configuration options:&#x000A;* &lt;tt&gt;message&lt;/tt&gt; - A custom error message (default is: &quot;is not a number&quot;)&#x000A;* &lt;tt&gt;on&lt;/tt&gt; Specifies when this validation is active (default is :save, other options :create, :update)&#x000A;* &lt;tt&gt;only_integer&lt;/tt&gt; Specifies whether the value has to be an integer, e.g. an integral value (default is false)</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that HasManyAssociation#count was using :finder_sql rather than
            :counter_sql if it was available 445 [Scott Barron]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added better defaults for composed_of, so statements like composed_of
            :time_zone, :mapping => %w( time_zone time_zone ) can be written without
            the mapping part (it&#8217;s now assumed)
            
            </li>

            <ul>
            <li>Changed the auto-timestamping feature to use <a
            href="../../../../classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#M002548">ActiveRecord::Base.default_timezone</a>
            instead of entertaining the parallel ActiveRecord::Base.timestamps_gmt
            method. The latter is now deprecated and will throw a warning on use (but
            still work) 710 [Jamis Buck]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added a OCI8-based Oracle adapter that has been verified to work with
            Oracle 8 and 9 629 [Graham Jenkins]. Usage notes:
            
            <pre>1.  Key generation uses a sequence &quot;rails_sequence&quot; for all tables. (I couldn't find a simple&#x000A;    and safe way of passing table-specific sequence information to the adapter.)&#x000A;2.  Oracle uses DATE or TIMESTAMP datatypes for both dates and times. Consequently I have had to&#x000A;    resort to some hacks to get data converted to Date or Time in Ruby.&#x000A;    If the column_name ends in _at (like created_at, updated_at) it's created as a Ruby Time. Else if the&#x000A;    hours/minutes/seconds are 0, I make it a Ruby Date. Else it's a Ruby Time.&#x000A;    This is nasty - but if you use Duck Typing you'll probably not care very much.&#x000A;    In 9i it's tempting to map DATE to Date and TIMESTAMP to Time but I don't think that is&#x000A;    valid - too many databases use DATE for both.&#x000A;    Timezones and sub-second precision on timestamps are not supported.&#x000A;3.  Default values that are functions (such as &quot;SYSDATE&quot;) are not supported. This is a&#x000A;    restriction of the way active record supports default values.&#x000A;4.  Referential integrity constraints are not fully supported. Under at least&#x000A;    some circumstances, active record appears to delete parent and child records out of&#x000A;    sequence and out of transaction scope. (Or this may just be a problem of test setup.)</pre>

            </li>
            <li>Added option :schema_order to the PostgreSQL adapter to support the use of
            multiple schemas per database 697 [YuriSchimke]
            
            </li>
            <li>Optimized the SQL used to generate has_and_belongs_to_many queries by
            listing the join table first 693 [yerejm]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that when using validation macros with a custom message, if you
            happened to use single quotes in the message string you would get a parsing
            error 657 [tonka]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that Active Record would throw Broken Pipe errors with FCGI when the
            MySQL connection timed out instead of reconnecting 428 [Nicholas Seckar]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added options to specify an SSL connection for MySQL. Define the following
            attributes in the connection config (config/database.yml in <a
            href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>) to use it: sslkey,
            sslcert, sslca, sslcapath, sslcipher. To use SSL with no client certs, just

            <li>Added automatic dropping/creating of test tables for running the unit tests
            on all databases 587 [adelle@bullet.net.au]
            
            </li>

            [demetrius]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed the SQL Server adapter on a bunch of issues 667 [DeLynn]
            
            <pre>1. Created a new columns method that is much cleaner.&#x000A;2. Corrected a problem with the select and select_all methods&#x000A;   that didn't account for the LIMIT clause being passed into raw SQL statements.&#x000A;3. Implemented the string_to_time method in order to create proper instances of the time class.&#x000A;4. Added logic to the simplified_type method that allows the database to specify the scale of float data.&#x000A;5. Adjusted the quote_column_name to account for the fact that MS SQL is bothered by a forward slash in the data string.</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that the dynamic finder like find_all_by_something_boolean(false)
            didn&#8217;t work 649 [lmarlow]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added validates_each that validates each specified attribute against a
            block 610 [Jeremy Kemper]. Example:
            
            <pre>class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  validates_each :first_name, :last_name do |record, attr|&#x000A;    record.errors.add attr, 'starts with z.' if attr[0] == ?z&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added :allow_nil as an explicit option for validates_length_of, so unless
            that&#8217;s set to true having the attribute as nil will also return an
            error if a range is specified as :within 610 [Jeremy Kemper]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added that validates_* now accept blocks to perform validations 618 [Tim
            Bates]. Example:
            
            <pre>class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  validate { |person| person.errors.add(&quot;title&quot;, &quot;will never be valid&quot;) if SHOULD_NEVER_BE_VALID }&#x000A;end</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Addded validation for validate all the associated objects before declaring
            failure with validates_associated 618 [Tim Bates]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added keyword-style approach to defining the custom relational bindings 545
            [Jamis Buck]. Example:
            
            <pre>class Project &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  primary_key &quot;sysid&quot;&#x000A;  table_name &quot;XYZ_PROJECT&quot;&#x000A;  inheritance_column { original_inheritance_column + &quot;_id&quot; }&#x000A;end</pre>

            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Added that has_many association build and create methods can take arrays of
            record data like Base#create and Base#build to build/create multiple
            records at once.
            
            </li>
            <li>Added that Base#delete and Base#destroy both can take an array of ids to
            delete/destroy 336
            
            </li>
            <li>Added the option of supplying an array of attributes to Base#create, so
            that multiple records can be created at once.
            
            </li>
            <li>Added the option of supplying an array of ids and attributes to
            Base#update, so that multiple records can be updated at once (inspired by
            526/Duane Johnson). Example
            
            <pre>people = { 1 =&gt; { &quot;first_name&quot; =&gt; &quot;David&quot; }, 2 =&gt; { &quot;first_name&quot; =&gt; &quot;Jeremy&quot;} }&#x000A;Person.update(people.keys, people.values)</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added ActiveRecord::Base.timestamps_gmt that can be set to true to make the
            automated timestamping use GMT instead of local time 520 [Scott Baron]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added that update_all calls sanitize_sql on its updates argument, so stuff
            like MyRecord.update_all([&#8216;time = ?&#8217;, Time.now]) works 519
            [notahat]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that the dynamic finders didn&#8217;t treat nil as a &#8220;IS
            NULL&#8221; but rather &#8220;= NULL&#8221; case 515 [Demetrius]

            <li>Added bind-named arrays for interpolating a group of ids or strings in

            </li>
            <li>Added that has_and_belongs_to_many associations with additional attributes
            also can be created between unsaved objects and only committed to the
            database when Base#save is called on the associator 524 [Eric Anderson]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that records fetched with piggy-back attributes or through rich
            has_and_belongs_to_many associations couldn&#8217;t be saved due to the
            extra attributes not part of the table 522 [Eric Anderson]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added mass-assignment protection for the inheritance column &#8212;

            &#8216;if project.manager&#8217; &#8212; this unfortunately also means that

            <li>Added validates_associated that enables validation of objects in an unsaved
            association 398 [Tim Bates]. Example:
            
            <pre>class Book &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  has_many :pages&#x000A;  belongs_to :library&#x000A;&#x000A;  validates_associated :pages, :library&#x000A;end</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added support for associating unsaved objects 402 [Tim Bates]. Rules that
            govern this addition:
            
            <pre>== Unsaved objects and associations&#x000A;&#x000A;You can manipulate objects and associations before they are saved to the database, but there is some special behaviour you should be&#x000A;aware of, mostly involving the saving of associated objects.&#x000A;&#x000A;=== One-to-one associations&#x000A;&#x000A;* Assigning an object to a has_one association automatically saves that object, and the object being replaced (if there is one), in&#x000A;  order to update their primary keys - except if the parent object is unsaved (new_record? == true).&#x000A;* If either of these saves fail (due to one of the objects being invalid) the assignment statement returns false and the assignment&#x000A;  is cancelled.&#x000A;* If you wish to assign an object to a has_one association without saving it, use the #association.build method (documented below).&#x000A;* Assigning an object to a belongs_to association does not save the object, since the foreign key field belongs on the parent. It does&#x000A;  not save the parent either.&#x000A;&#x000A;=== Collections&#x000A;&#x000A;* Adding an object to a collection (has_many or has_and_belongs_to_many) automatically saves that object, except if the parent object&#x000A;  (the owner of the collection) is not yet stored in the database.&#x000A;* If saving any of the objects being added to a collection (via #push or similar) fails, then #push returns false.&#x000A;* You can add an object to a collection without automatically saving it by using the #collection.build method (documented below).&#x000A;* All unsaved (new_record? == true) members of the collection are automatically saved when the parent is saved.</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added replace to associations, so you can do
            project.manager.replace(new_manager) or
            project.milestones.replace(new_milestones) 402 [Tim Bates]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added build and create methods to has_one and belongs_to associations, so
            you can now do project.manager.build(attributes) 402 [Tim Bates]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added that if a before_* callback returns false, all the later callbacks
            and the associated action are cancelled. If an after_* callback returns
            false, all the later callbacks are cancelled. Callbacks are generally run
            in the order they are defined, with the exception of callbacks defined as
            methods on the model, which are called last. 402 [Tim Bates]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that Base#== wouldn&#8217;t work for multiple references to the same
            unsaved object 402 [Tim Bates]
            
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>Added a differenciation between AssociationCollection#size and -length. Now
            AssociationCollection#size returns the size of the collection by executing
            a SELECT COUNT(*) query if the collection hasn&#8217;t been loaded and
            calling collection.size if it has. If it&#8217;s more likely than not that
            the collection does have a size larger than zero and you need to fetch that
            collection afterwards, it&#8217;ll take one less SELECT query if you use
            length.

            <li>Added Base#attributes that returns a hash of all the attributes with their
            names as keys and clones of their objects as values 433 [atyp.de]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that foreign keys named the same as the association would cause stack
            overflow 437 [Eric Anderson]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed default scope of acts_as_list from &#8220;1&#8221; to &#8220;1 =
            1&#8221;, so it&#8217;ll work in PostgreSQL (among other places) 427
            [Alexey]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added Base#reload that reloads the attributes of an object from the
            database 422 [Andreas Schwarz]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added SQLite3 compatibility through the sqlite3-ruby adapter by Jamis Buck
            381 [Jeremy Kemper]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added support for the new protocol spoken by MySQL 4.1.1+ servers for the
            Ruby/MySQL adapter that ships with <a
            href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 440 [Matt Mower]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added that Observers can use the observes class method instead of
            overwriting self.observed_class().
            
            <pre>Before:&#x000A;  class ListSweeper &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;    def self.observed_class() [ List, Item ]&#x000A;  end&#x000A;&#x000A;After:&#x000A;  class ListSweeper &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;    observes List, Item&#x000A;  end</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that conditions in has_many and has_and_belongs_to_many should be
            interpolated just like the finder_sql is
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed Base#update_attribute to be indifferent to whether a string or symbol
            is used to describe the name
            
            </li>
            <li>Added Base#toggle(attribute) and Base#toggle!(attribute) that makes it
            easier to flip a switch or flag.
            
            <pre>Before: topic.update_attribute(:approved, !approved?)&#x000A;After : topic.toggle!(:approved)</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added Base#increment!(attribute) and Base#decrement!(attribute) that also
            saves the records. Example:
            
            <pre>page.views # =&gt; 1&#x000A;page.increment!(:views) # executes an UPDATE statement&#x000A;page.views # =&gt; 2&#x000A;&#x000A;page.increment(:views).increment!(:views)&#x000A;page.views # =&gt; 4</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added Base#increment(attribute) and Base#decrement(attribute) that
            encapsulates the += 1 and -= 1 patterns.
            
            </li>

            <ul>
            <li>Added automated optimistic locking if the field <tt>lock_version</tt> is
            present. Each update to the record increments the lock_version column and
            the locking facilities ensure that records instantiated twice will let the
            last one saved raise a StaleObjectError if the first was also updated.
            Example:
            
            <pre>p1 = Person.find(1)&#x000A;p2 = Person.find(1)&#x000A;&#x000A;p1.first_name = &quot;Michael&quot;&#x000A;p1.save&#x000A;&#x000A;p2.first_name = &quot;should fail&quot;&#x000A;p2.save # Raises a ActiveRecord::StaleObjectError</pre>

            You&#8217;re then responsible for dealing with the conflict by rescuing the
            exception and either rolling back, merging, or otherwise apply the business
            logic needed to resolve the conflict.
            </p>

            </p>
            </li>
            <li>Added dynamic attribute-based finders as a cleaner way of getting objects
            by simple queries without turning to SQL. They work by appending the name
            of an attribute to <tt>find_by_</tt>, so you get finders like
            <tt>Person.find_by_user_name, Payment.find_by_transaction_id</tt>. So
            instead of writing <tt>Person.find_first([&quot;user_name = ?&quot;,
            user_name])</tt>, you just do <tt>Person.find_by_user_name(user_name)</tt>.
            
            <p>
            It&#8217;s also possible to use multiple attributes in the same find by
            separating them with &#8220;<em>and</em>&#8220;, so you get finders like
            <tt>Person.find_by_user_name_and_password</tt> or even
            <tt>Payment.find_by_purchaser_and_state_and_country</tt>. So instead of
            writing <tt>Person.find_first([&quot;user_name = ? AND password = ?&quot;,
            user_name, password])</tt>, you just do
            <tt>Person.find_by_user_name_and_password(user_name, password)</tt>.
            </p>
            <p>
            While primarily a construct for easier find_firsts, it can also be used as
            a construct for find_all by using calls like
            <tt>Payment.find_all_by_amount(50)</tt> that is turned into
            <tt>Payment.find_all([&quot;amount = ?&quot;, 50])</tt>. This is something
            not as equally useful, though, as it&#8217;s not possible to specify the
            order in which the objects are returned.
            </p>

            <li>Added block-style for callbacks 332 [Jeremy Kemper].

            </li>
            <li>Added :counter_cache option to acts_as_tree that works just like the one
            you can define on belongs_to 371 [Josh Peek]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added Base.default_timezone accessor that determines whether to use
            Time.local (using :local) or Time.utc (using :utc) when pulling dates and
            times from the database. This is set to :local by default.
            
            </li>
            <li>Added the possibility for adapters to overwrite add_limit! to implement a
            different limiting scheme than &#8220;LIMIT X&#8221; used by MySQL,
            PostgreSQL, and SQLite.
            
            </li>
            <li>Added the possibility of having objects with acts_as_list created before
            their scope is available or...
            
            </li>
            <li>Added a db2 adapter that only depends on the Ruby/DB2 bindings (<a

            <li>Added the final touches to the Microsoft SQL Server adapter by Joey Gibson
            that makes it suitable for actual use 394 [DeLynn Barry]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added that Base#find takes an optional options hash, including :conditions.
            Base#find_on_conditions deprecated in favor of find with :conditions 407
            [Jeremy Kemper]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added HasManyAssociation#count that works like Base#count 413 [intinig]

            </li>
            <li>Fixed a bug in the Ruby/MySQL that caused binary content to be escaped
            badly and come back mangled 405 [Tobias Lütke]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that the const_missing autoload assumes the requested constant is set
            by require_association and calls const_get to retrieve it. If
            require_association did not set the constant then const_get will call
            const_missing, resulting in an infinite loop 380 [Jeremy Kemper]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed broken transactions that were actually only running object-level and

            </li>
            <li>Fixed that validates_uniqueness_of used &#8216;id&#8217; instead of defined
            primary key 406
            
            </li>

            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Added a require_association hook on const_missing that makes it possible to
            use any model class without requiring it first. This makes STI look like:
            
            <pre>before:&#x000A;  require_association 'person'&#x000A;  class Employee &lt; Person&#x000A;  end&#x000A;&#x000A;after:&#x000A;  class Employee &lt; Person&#x000A;  end</pre>
            <p>
            This also reduces the usefulness of Controller.model in Action Pack to
            currently only being for documentation purposes.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>Added that Base.update_all and Base.delete_all return an integer of the

            </li>
            <li>Added respondence to *_before_type_cast for all attributes to return their
            string-state before they were type casted by the column type. This is
            helpful for getting &#8220;100,000&#8221; back on a integer-based
            validation where the value would normally be &#8220;100&#8221;.
            
            </li>
            <li>Added allow_nil options to validates_inclusion_of so that validation is

            </li>
            <li>Added work-around for PostgreSQL and the problem of getting fixtures to be
            created from id 1 on each test case. This only works for auto-incrementing
            primary keys called &#8220;id&#8221; for now 359 [Scott Baron]

            <li>Fixed that overriding an attribute&#8217;s accessor would be disregarded by
            add_on_empty and add_on_boundary_breaking because they simply used the

            transaction have the responsibilty of starting and rolling back the
            transaction. If any of the inner transactions swallow the exception raised,
            though, the transaction will not be rolled back. So always let the

            <li>Added a better exception for when a type column is used in a table without
            the intention of triggering single-table inheritance. Example:
            
            <pre>ActiveRecord::SubclassNotFound: The single-table inheritance mechanism failed to locate the subclass: 'bad_class!'.&#x000A;This error is raised because the column 'type' is reserved for storing the class in case of inheritance.&#x000A;Please rename this column if you didn't intend it to be used for storing the inheritance class or&#x000A;overwrite Company.inheritance_column to use another column for that information.</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added that single-table inheritance will only kick in if the
            inheritance_column (by default &#8220;type&#8221;) is present. Otherwise,
            inheritance won&#8217;t have any magic side effects.

            <pre>Before:&#x000A;  errors.add(:name, &quot;must be shorter&quot;) if name.size &gt; 10&#x000A;  errors.on(:name)  # =&gt; &quot;must be shorter&quot;&#x000A;  errors.on(&quot;name&quot;) # =&gt; nil&#x000A;&#x000A;After:&#x000A;  errors.add(:name, &quot;must be shorter&quot;) if name.size &gt; 10&#x000A;  errors.on(:name)  # =&gt; &quot;must be shorter&quot;&#x000A;  errors.on(&quot;name&quot;) # =&gt; &quot;must be shorter&quot;</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added Base.validates_format_of that Validates whether the value of the
            specified attribute is of the correct form by matching it against the
            regular expression provided. [Marcel Molina Jr.]
            
            <pre>class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  validates_format_of :email, :with =&gt; /^([^@\s]+)@((?:[-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,})$/, :on =&gt; :create&#x000A;end</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added Base.validates_length_of that delegates to add_on_boundary_breaking
            312 [Tobias Lütke]. Example:
            
            <pre>Validates that the specified attribute matches the length restrictions supplied in either:&#x000A;&#x000A;  - configuration[:minimum]&#x000A;  - configuration[:maximum]&#x000A;  - configuration[:is]&#x000A;  - configuration[:within] (aka. configuration[:in])&#x000A;&#x000A;Only one option can be used at a time.&#x000A;&#x000A;  class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;    validates_length_of :first_name, :maximum=&gt;30&#x000A;    validates_length_of :last_name, :maximum=&gt;30, :message=&gt;&quot;less than %d if you don't mind&quot;&#x000A;    validates_length_of :user_name, :within =&gt; 6..20, :too_long =&gt; &quot;pick a shorter name&quot;, :too_short =&gt; &quot;pick a longer name&quot;&#x000A;    validates_length_of :fav_bra_size, :minimum=&gt;1, :too_short=&gt;&quot;please enter at least %d character&quot;&#x000A;    validates_length_of :smurf_leader, :is=&gt;4, :message=&gt;&quot;papa is spelled with %d characters... don't play me.&quot;&#x000A;  end</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added Base.validate_presence as an alternative to implementing validate and
            doing errors.add_on_empty yourself.
            
            </li>
            <li>Added Base.validates_uniqueness_of that alidates whether the value of the
            specified attributes are unique across the system. Useful for making sure
            that only one user can be named &#8220;davidhh&#8221;.
            
            <pre>class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  validates_uniqueness_of :user_name&#x000A;end</pre>
            <p>
            When the record is created, a check is performed to make sure that no
            record exist in the database with the given value for the specified
            attribute (that maps to a column). When the record is updated, the same
            check is made but disregarding the record itself.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>Added Base.validates_confirmation_of that encapsulates the pattern of
            wanting to validate a password or email address field with a confirmation.
            Example:
            
            <pre>  Model:&#x000A;    class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;      validates_confirmation_of :password&#x000A;    end&#x000A;&#x000A;  View:&#x000A;    &lt;%= password_field &quot;person&quot;, &quot;password&quot; %&gt;&#x000A;    &lt;%= password_field &quot;person&quot;, &quot;password_confirmation&quot; %&gt;&#x000A;&#x000A;The person has to already have a password attribute (a column in the people table), but the password_confirmation is virtual.&#x000A;It exists only as an in-memory variable for validating the password. This check is performed both on create and update.</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added Base.validates_acceptance_of that encapsulates the pattern of wanting
            to validate the acceptance of a terms of service check box (or similar
            agreement). Example:
            
            <pre>class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  validates_acceptance_of :terms_of_service&#x000A;end</pre>
            <p>
            The terms_of_service attribute is entirely virtual. No database column is
            needed. This check is performed both on create and update.
            </p>
            <p>
            NOTE: The agreement is considered valid if it&#8217;s set to the string
            &#8220;1&#8221;. This makes it easy to relate it to an HTML checkbox.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>Added validation macros to make the stackable just like the lifecycle
            callbacks. Examples:
            
            <pre>class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  validate { |record| record.errors.add(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;too short&quot;) unless name.size &gt; 10 }&#x000A;  validate { |record| record.errors.add(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;too long&quot;)  unless name.size &lt; 20 }&#x000A;  validate_on_create :validate_password&#x000A;&#x000A;  private&#x000A;    def validate_password&#x000A;      errors.add(&quot;password&quot;, &quot;too short&quot;) unless password.size &gt; 6&#x000A;    end&#x000A;end</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added the option for sanitizing find_by_sql and the offset parts in regular
            finds [Sam Stephenson]. Examples:
            
            <pre>Project.find_all [&quot;category = ?&quot;, category_name], &quot;created ASC&quot;, [&quot;? OFFSET ?&quot;, 15, 20]&#x000A;Post.find_by_sql [&quot;SELECT * FROM posts WHERE author = ? AND created &gt; ?&quot;, author_id, start_date]</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Fixed value quoting in all generated SQL statements, so that integers are
            not surrounded in quotes and that all sanitation are happening through the
            database&#8217;s own quoting routine. This should hopefully make it lots
            easier for new adapters that doesn&#8217;t accept &#8216;1&#8217; for
            integer columns.
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed has_and_belongs_to_many guessing of foreign key so that keys are
            generated correctly for models like SomeVerySpecialClient [Florian Weber]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added counter_sql option for has_many associations [Jeremy Kemper].
            Documentation:
            
            <pre>&lt;tt&gt;:counter_sql&lt;/tt&gt; - specify a complete SQL statement to fetch the size of the association. If +:finder_sql+ is&#x000A;specified but +:counter_sql+, +:counter_sql+ will be generated by replacing SELECT ... FROM with SELECT COUNT(*) FROM.</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that methods wrapped in callbacks still return their original result
            260 [Jeremy Kemper]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed the Inflector to handle the movie/movies pair correctly 261 [Scott
            Baron]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added named bind-style variable interpolation 281 [Michael Koziarski].
            Example:
            
            <pre>Person.find([&quot;id = :id and first_name = :first_name&quot;, { :id =&gt; 5, :first_name = &quot;bob' or 1=1&quot; }])</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added bind-style variable interpolation for the condition arrays that uses
            the adapter&#8217;s quote method [Michael Koziarski]
            
            <p>
            Before:
            </p>
            <pre>find_first([ &quot;user_name = '%s' AND password = '%s'&quot;, user_name, password ])]&#x000A;find_first([ &quot;firm_id = %s&quot;, firm_id ])] # unsafe!</pre>
            <p>
            After:
            </p>
            <pre>find_first([ &quot;user_name = ? AND password = ?&quot;, user_name, password ])]&#x000A;find_first([ &quot;firm_id = ?&quot;, firm_id ])]</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added CSV format for fixtures 272 [what-a-day]. (See the new and expanded
            documentation on fixtures for more information)
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed fixtures using primary key fields called something else than
            &#8220;id&#8221; [dave]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added proper handling of time fields that are turned into Time objects with
            the dummy date of 2000/1/1 [HariSeldon]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added reverse order of deleting fixtures, so referential keys can be
            maintained 247 [Tim Bates]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added relative path search for sqlite dbfiles in database.yml (if
            RAILS_ROOT is defined) 233 [Jeremy Kemper]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added option to establish_connection where you&#8217;ll be able to leave
            out the parameter to have it use the RAILS_ENV environment variable
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed problems with primary keys and postgresql sequences (230) [Tim Bates]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added reloading for associations under cached environments like FastCGI and
            mod_ruby. This makes it possible to use those environments for development.
            This is turned on by default, but can be turned off with
            ActiveRecord::Base.reload_dependencies = false in production environments.
            
            <p>
            NOTE: This will only have an effect if you let the associations manage the
            requiring of model classes. All libraries loaded through require will be
            &#8220;forever&#8221; cached. You can, however, use
            ActiveRecord::Base.load_or_require(&#8220;library&#8221;) to get this
            behavior outside of the auto-loading associations.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>Added <a href="../../../../classes/ERB.html">ERB</a> capabilities to the
            fixture files for dynamic fixture generation. You don&#8217;t need to do
            anything, just include <a href="../../../../classes/ERB.html">ERB</a>
            blocks like:
            
            <pre>david:&#x000A;  id: 1&#x000A;  name: David&#x000A;&#x000A;jamis:&#x000A;  id: 2&#x000A;  name: Jamis&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;% for digit in 3..10 %&gt;&#x000A;dev_&lt;%= digit %&gt;:&#x000A;  id: &lt;%= digit %&gt;&#x000A;  name: fixture_&lt;%= digit %&gt;&#x000A;&lt;% end %&gt;</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Changed the yaml fixture searcher to look in the root of the fixtures
            directory, so when you before could have something like:
            
            <pre>fixtures/developers/fixtures.yaml&#x000A;fixtures/accounts/fixtures.yaml</pre>
            <p>
            &#8230;you now need to do:
            </p>
            <pre>fixtures/developers.yaml&#x000A;fixtures/accounts.yaml</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Changed the fixture format from:
            
            <pre>name: david&#x000A;data:&#x000A; id: 1&#x000A; name: David Heinemeier Hansson&#x000A; birthday: 1979-10-15&#x000A; profession: Systems development&#x000A;---&#x000A;name: steve&#x000A;data:&#x000A; id: 2&#x000A; name: Steve Ross Kellock&#x000A; birthday: 1974-09-27&#x000A; profession: guy with keyboard</pre>
            <p>
            &#8230;to:
            </p>
            <pre>david:&#x000A; id: 1&#x000A; name: David Heinemeier Hansson&#x000A; birthday: 1979-10-15&#x000A; profession: Systems development&#x000A;&#x000A;steve:&#x000A; id: 2&#x000A; name: Steve Ross Kellock&#x000A; birthday: 1974-09-27&#x000A; profession: guy with keyboard</pre>
            <p>
            The change is NOT backwards compatible. <a
            href="../../../../classes/Fixtures.html">Fixtures</a> written in the old
            YAML style needs to be rewritten!
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>All associations will now attempt to require the classes that they
            associate to. Relieving the need for most explicit &#8216;require&#8217;
            statements.
            
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            <b>1.1.0</b> (34)
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Added automatic fixture setup and instance variable availability. <a
            href="../../../../classes/Fixtures.html">Fixtures</a> can also be
            automatically instantiated in instance variables relating to their names
            using the following style:
            
            <pre>class FixturesTest &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase&#x000A;  fixtures :developers # you can add more with comma separation&#x000A;&#x000A;  def test_developers&#x000A;    assert_equal 3, @developers.size # the container for all the fixtures is automatically set&#x000A;    assert_kind_of Developer, @david # works like @developers[&quot;david&quot;].find&#x000A;    assert_equal &quot;David Heinemeier Hansson&quot;, @david.name&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added HasAndBelongsToManyAssociation#push_with_attributes(object,
            join_attributes) that can create associations in the join table with
            additional attributes. This is really useful when you have information
            that&#8217;s only relevant to the join itself, such as a
            &#8220;added_on&#8220; column for an association between post and category.
            The added attributes will automatically be injected into objects retrieved
            through the association similar to the piggy-back approach:
            
            <pre>post.categories.push_with_attributes(category, :added_on =&gt; Date.today)&#x000A;post.categories.first.added_on # =&gt; Date.today</pre>
            <p>
            NOTE: The categories table doesn&#8217;t have a added_on column, it&#8217;s
            the categories_post join table that does!
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that :exclusively_dependent and :dependent can&#8217;t be activated
            at the same time on has_many associations [Jeremy Kemper]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that database passwords couldn&#8217;t be all numeric [Jeremy Kemper]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that calling id would create the instance variable for new_records
            preventing them from being saved correctly [Jeremy Kemper]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added sanitization feature to HasManyAssociation#find_all so it works just
            like Base.find_all [Sam Stephenson/Jeremy Kemper]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added that you can pass overlapping ids to find without getting duplicated
            records back [Jeremy Kemper]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added that Base.benchmark returns the result of the block [Jeremy Kemper]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed problem with unit tests on Windows with SQLite [paterno]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that quotes would break regular non-yaml fixtures [Dmitry
            Sabanin/daft]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed fixtures on windows with line endings cause problems under unix / mac
            [Tobias Lütke]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added HasAndBelongsToManyAssociation#find(id) that&#8217;ll search inside
            the collection and find the object or record with that id
            
            </li>
            <li>Added :conditions option to has_and_belongs_to_many that works just like
            the one on all the other associations
            
            </li>
            <li>Added AssociationCollection#clear to remove all associations from has_many
            and has_and_belongs_to_many associations without destroying the records
            [geech]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added type-checking and remove in 1-instead-of-N sql statements to
            AssociationCollection#delete [geech]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added a return of self to AssociationCollection#<< so appending can be
            chained, like project << Milestone.create << Milestone.create [geech]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added Base#hash and Base#eql? which means that all of the equality using
            features of array and other containers now works:
            
            <pre>[ Person.find(1), Person.find(2), Person.find(3) ] &amp; [ Person.find(1), Person.find(4) ] # =&gt; [ Person.find(1) ]</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added :uniq as an option to has_and_belongs_to_many which will
            automatically ensure that AssociateCollection#uniq is called before pulling
            records out of the association. This is especially useful for three-way
            (and above) has_and_belongs_to_many associations.
            
            </li>
            <li>Added AssociateCollection#uniq which is especially useful for
            has_and_belongs_to_many associations that can include duplicates, which is
            common on associations that also use metadata. Usage: post.categories.uniq
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed respond_to? to use a subclass specific hash instead of an Active
            Record-wide one
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed has_and_belongs_to_many to treat associations between classes in
            modules properly [Florian Weber]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added a NoMethod exception to be raised when query and writer methods are

            pulling records out through has_and_belongs_to_many associations. This is

            </li>
            <li>Added Fixture#find to find the record corresponding to the fixture id. The
            record class name is guessed by using Inflector#classify (also new) on the
            fixture directory name.
            
            <pre>Before: Document.find(@documents[&quot;first&quot;][&quot;id&quot;])&#x000A;After : @documents[&quot;first&quot;].find</pre>

            <li>Fixed a bug with Base#size when a finder_sql was used that didn&#8217;t
            capitalize SELECT and FROM [geech]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed quoting problems on SQLite by adding quote_string to the
            AbstractAdapter that can be overwritten by the concrete adapters for a call
            to the dbm. [Andreas Schwarz]
            
            </li>
            <li>Removed RubyGems backup strategy for requiring SQLite-adapter &#8212; if
            people want to use gems, they&#8217;re already doing it with AR.

            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Added OO-style associations methods [Florian Weber]. Examples:
            
            <pre>Project#milestones_count       =&gt; Project#milestones.size&#x000A;Project#build_to_milestones    =&gt; Project#milestones.build&#x000A;Project#create_for_milestones  =&gt; Project#milestones.create&#x000A;Project#find_in_milestones     =&gt; Project#milestones.find&#x000A;Project#find_all_in_milestones =&gt; Project#milestones.find_all</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added serialize as a new class method to control when text attributes
            should be YAMLized or not. This means that automated serialization of
            hashes, arrays, and so on WILL NO LONGER HAPPEN (10). You need to do
            something like this:
            
            <pre>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  serialize :settings&#x000A;end</pre>
            <p>
            This will assume that settings is a text column and will now YAMLize any
            object put in that attribute. You can also specify an optional :class_name
            option that&#8217;ll raise an exception if a serialized object is retrieved
            as a descendant of a class not in the hierarchy. Example:
            </p>
            <pre>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  serialize :settings, :class_name =&gt; &quot;Hash&quot;&#x000A;end&#x000A;&#x000A;user = User.create(&quot;settings&quot; =&gt; %w( one two three ))&#x000A;User.find(user.id).settings # =&gt; raises SerializationTypeMismatch</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added the option to connect to a different database for one model at a
            time. Just call establish_connection on the class you want to have
            connected to another database than Base. This will automatically also
            connect decendents of that class to the different database [Renald Buter].
            
            </li>
            <li>Added transactional protection for Base#save. Validations can now check for
            values knowing that it happens in a transaction and callbacks can raise
            exceptions knowing that the save will be rolled back. [Suggested by Alexey
            Verkhovsky]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added column name quoting so reserved words, such as
            &#8220;references&#8221;, can be used as column names [Ryan Platte]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added the possibility to chain the return of what happened inside a logged
            block [geech]:
            
            <pre>This now works:&#x000A;  log { ... }.map { ... }&#x000A;&#x000A;Instead of doing:&#x000A;  result = []&#x000A;  log { result = ... }&#x000A;  result.map { ... }</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added &#8220;socket&#8221; option for the MySQL adapter, so you can change
            it to something else than &#8220;/tmp/mysql.sock&#8220; [Anna Lissa Cruz]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added respond_to? answers for all the attribute methods. So if Person has a
            name attribute retrieved from the table schema, person.respond_to?
            &#8220;name&#8221; will return true.
            
            </li>
            <li>Added Base.benchmark which can be used to aggregate logging and benchmark,
            so you can measure and represent multiple statements in a single block.
            Usage (hides all the SQL calls for the individual actions and calculates
            total runtime for them all):
            
            <pre>Project.benchmark(&quot;Creating project&quot;) do&#x000A;  project = Project.create(&quot;name&quot; =&gt; &quot;stuff&quot;)&#x000A;  project.create_manager(&quot;name&quot; =&gt; &quot;David&quot;)&#x000A;  project.milestones &lt;&lt; Milestone.find_all&#x000A;end</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added logging of invalid SQL statements [Daniel Von Fange]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added alias Errors#[] for Errors#on, so you can now say
            person.errors[&#8220;name&#8221;] to retrieve the errors for name [Andreas
            Schwarz]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added RubyGems require attempt if sqlite-ruby is not available through
            regular methods.
            
            </li>
            <li>Added compatibility with 2.x series of sqlite-ruby drivers. [Jamis Buck]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added type safety for association assignments, so a <a
            href="../../../../classes/ActiveRecord/AssociationTypeMismatch.html">ActiveRecord::AssociationTypeMismatch</a>
            will be raised if you attempt to assign an object that&#8217;s not of the
            associated class. This cures the problem with nil giving id = 4 and fixnums
            giving id = 1 on mistaken association assignments. [Reported by Andreas
            Schwarz]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added the option to keep many fixtures in one single YAML document
            [what-a-day]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added the class method &#8220;inheritance_column&#8220; that can be
            overwritten to return the name of an alternative column than
            &#8220;type&#8221; for storing the type for inheritance hierarchies. [Dave
            Steinberg]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added [] and []= as an alternative way to access attributes when the
            regular methods have been overwritten [Dave Steinberg]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added the option to observer more than one class at the time by specifying
            observed_class as an array
            
            </li>
            <li>Added auto-id propagation support for tables with arbitrary primary keys
            that have autogenerated sequences associated with them on PostgreSQL. [Dave
            Steinberg]
            
            </li>
            <li>Changed that integer and floats set to &#8220;&#8221; through attributes=
            remain as NULL. This was especially a problem for scaffolding and
            postgresql. (49)
            
            </li>
            <li>Changed the MySQL Adapter to rely on MySQL for its defaults for socket,
            host, and port [Andreas Schwarz]
            
            </li>
            <li>Changed ActionControllerError to decent from StandardError instead of
            Exception. It can now be caught by a generic rescue.
            
            </li>
            <li>Changed class inheritable attributes to not use eval [Caio Chassot]
            
            </li>
            <li>Changed Errors#add to now use &#8220;invalid&#8221; as the default message
            instead of true, which means full_messages work with those [Marcel Molina
            Jr.]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed spelling on Base#add_on_boundry_breaking to
            Base#add_on_boundary_breaking (old naming still works) [Marcel Molina Jr.]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed that entries in the has_and_belongs_to_many join table didn&#8217;t
            get removed when an associated object was destroyed.
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed unnecessary calls to SET AUTOCOMMIT=0/1 for MySQL adapter [Andreas
            Schwarz]

            <li>Expanded the table_name guessing rules immensely [Florian Green].
            Documentation:
            
            <pre>Guesses the table name (in forced lower-case) based on the name of the class in the inheritance hierarchy descending&#x000A;directly from ActiveRecord. So if the hierarchy looks like: Reply &lt; Message &lt; ActiveRecord, then Message is used&#x000A;to guess the table name from even when called on Reply. The guessing rules are as follows:&#x000A;* Class name ends in &quot;x&quot;, &quot;ch&quot; or &quot;ss&quot;: &quot;es&quot; is appended, so a Search class becomes a searches table.&#x000A;* Class name ends in &quot;y&quot; preceded by a consonant or &quot;qu&quot;: The &quot;y&quot; is replaced with &quot;ies&quot;,&#x000A;  so a Category class becomes a categories table.&#x000A;* Class name ends in &quot;fe&quot;: The &quot;fe&quot; is replaced with &quot;ves&quot;, so a Wife class becomes a wives table.&#x000A;* Class name ends in &quot;lf&quot; or &quot;rf&quot;: The &quot;f&quot; is replaced with &quot;ves&quot;, so a Half class becomes a halves table.&#x000A;* Class name ends in &quot;person&quot;: The &quot;person&quot; is replaced with &quot;people&quot;, so a Salesperson class becomes a salespeople table.&#x000A;* Class name ends in &quot;man&quot;: The &quot;man&quot; is replaced with &quot;men&quot;, so a Spokesman class becomes a spokesmen table.&#x000A;* Class name ends in &quot;sis&quot;: The &quot;i&quot; is replaced with an &quot;e&quot;, so a Basis class becomes a bases table.&#x000A;* Class name ends in &quot;tum&quot; or &quot;ium&quot;: The &quot;um&quot; is replaced with an &quot;a&quot;, so a Datum class becomes a data table.&#x000A;* Class name ends in &quot;child&quot;: The &quot;child&quot; is replaced with &quot;children&quot;, so a NodeChild class becomes a node_children table.&#x000A;* Class name ends in an &quot;s&quot;: No additional characters are added or removed.&#x000A;* Class name doesn't end in &quot;s&quot;: An &quot;s&quot; is appended, so a Comment class becomes a comments table.&#x000A;* Class name with word compositions: Compositions are underscored, so CreditCard class becomes a credit_cards table.&#x000A;Additionally, the class-level table_name_prefix is prepended to the table_name and the table_name_suffix is appended.&#x000A;So if you have &quot;myapp_&quot; as a prefix, the table name guess for an Account class becomes &quot;myapp_accounts&quot;.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also overwrite this class method to allow for unguessable links, such as a Mouse class with a link to a&#x000A;&quot;mice&quot; table. Example:&#x000A;&#x000A;  class Mouse &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;     def self.table_name() &quot;mice&quot; end&#x000A;  end</pre>
            <p>
            This conversion is now done through an external class called Inflector
            residing in lib/active_record/support/inflector.rb.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>Added find_all_in_collection to has_many defined collections. Works like
            this:
            
            <pre>class Firm &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  has_many :clients&#x000A;end&#x000A;&#x000A;firm.id # =&gt; 1&#x000A;firm.find_all_in_clients &quot;revenue &gt; 1000&quot; # SELECT * FROM clients WHERE firm_id = 1 AND revenue &gt; 1000</pre>

            </p>

            <li>Fixed finders for inheritance hierarchies deeper than one level [Florian
            Weber]
            
            </li>
            <li>Added add_on_boundry_breaking to errors to accompany add_on_empty as a
            default validation method. It&#8217;s used like this:
            
            <pre>class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  protected&#x000A;    def validation&#x000A;      errors.add_on_boundry_breaking &quot;password&quot;, 3..20&#x000A;    end&#x000A;end</pre>
            <p>
            This will add an error to the tune of &#8220;is too short (minimum is 3
            characters)&#8221; or &#8220;is too long (minimum is 20 characters)&#8221;
            if the password is outside the boundry. The messages can be changed by
            passing a third and forth parameter as message strings.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>Implemented a clone method that works properly with AR. It returns a clone
            of the record that hasn&#8217;t been assigned an id yet and is treated as a

            <pre>If set to true all the associated object are deleted in one SQL statement without having their&#x000A;before_destroy callback run. This should only be used on associations that depend solely on&#x000A;this class and don't need to do any clean-up in before_destroy. The upside is that it's much&#x000A;faster, especially if there's a counter_cache involved.</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added :port key to connection options, so the PostgreSQL and MySQL adapters
            can connect to a database server running on another port than the default.

            <li>Converted the new natural singleton methods that prevented AR objects from
            being saved by PStore (and hence be placed in a <a

            </li>
            <li>Added natural object-style assignment for has_and_belongs_to_many
            associations. Consider the following model:
            
            <pre>class Event &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  has_one_and_belongs_to_many :sponsors&#x000A;end&#x000A;&#x000A;class Sponsor &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  has_one_and_belongs_to_many :sponsors&#x000A;end</pre>
            <p>
            Earlier, you&#8217;d have to use synthetic methods for creating
            associations between two objects of the above class:
            </p>
            <pre>roskilde_festival.add_to_sponsors(carlsberg)&#x000A;roskilde_festival.remove_from_sponsors(carlsberg)&#x000A;&#x000A;nike.add_to_events(world_cup)&#x000A;nike.remove_from_events(world_cup)</pre>
            <p>
            Now you can use regular array-styled methods:
            </p>
            <pre>roskilde_festival.sponsors &lt;&lt; carlsberg&#x000A;roskilde_festival.sponsors.delete(carlsberg)&#x000A;&#x000A;nike.events &lt;&lt; world_cup&#x000A;nike.events.delete(world_cup)</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Added delete method for has_many associations. Using this will nullify an
            association between the has_many and the belonging object by setting the
            foreign key to null. Consider this model:
            
            <pre>class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  has_many :comments&#x000A;end&#x000A;&#x000A;class Comment &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  belongs_to :post&#x000A;end</pre>
            <p>
            You could do something like:
            </p>
            <pre>funny_comment.has_post? # =&gt; true&#x000A;announcement.comments.delete(funny_comment)&#x000A;funny_comment.has_post? # =&gt; false</pre>

            <li>Active Record is now thread safe! (So you can use it with Cerise and
            WEBrick applications) [Implementation idea by Michael Neumann, debugging
            assistance by Jamis Buck]
            
            </li>
            <li>Improved performance by roughly 400% on a basic test case of pulling 100
            records and querying one attribute. This brings the tax for using Active
            Record instead of &#8220;riding on the metal&#8221; (using MySQL-ruby
            C-driver directly) down to ~50%. Done by doing lazy type conversions and
            caching column information on the class-level.
            
            </li>
            <li>Added callback objects and procs as options for implementing the target for
            callback macros.
            
            </li>
            <li>Added &#8220;counter_cache&#8220; option to belongs_to that automates the
            usage of increment_counter and decrement_counter. Consider:
            
            <pre>class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  has_many :comments&#x000A;end&#x000A;&#x000A;class Comment &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  belongs_to :post&#x000A;end</pre>
            <p>
            Iterating over 100 posts like this:
            </p>
            <pre>&lt;% for post in @posts %&gt;&#x000A;  &lt;%= post.title %&gt; has &lt;%= post.comments_count %&gt; comments&#x000A;&lt;% end %&gt;</pre>
            <p>
            Will generate 100 SQL count queries &#8212; one for each call to
            post.comments_count. If you instead add a &#8220;comments_count&#8220; int
            column to the posts table and rewrite the comments association macro with:
            </p>
            <pre>class Comment &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  belongs_to :post, :counter_cache =&gt; true&#x000A;end</pre>
            <p>
            Those 100 SQL count queries will be reduced to zero. Beware that counter
            caching is only appropriate for objects that begin life with the object
            it&#8217;s specified to belong with and is destroyed like that as well.
            Typically objects where you would also specify :dependent => true. If your
            objects switch from one belonging to another (like a post that can be move
            from one category to another), you&#8217;ll have to manage the counter
            yourself.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>Added natural object-style assignment for has_one and belongs_to
            associations. Consider the following model:
            
            <pre>class Project &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  has_one :manager&#x000A;end&#x000A;&#x000A;class Manager &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  belongs_to :project&#x000A;end</pre>
            <p>
            Earlier, assignments would work like following regardless of which way the
            assignment told the best story:
            </p>
            <pre>active_record.manager_id = david.id</pre>
            <p>
            Now you can do it either from the belonging side:
            </p>
            <pre>david.project = active_record</pre>
            <p>
            &#8230;or from the having side:
            </p>
            <pre>active_record.manager = david</pre>
            <p>
            If the assignment happens from the having side, the assigned object is
            automatically saved. So in the example above, the project_id attribute on
            david would be set to the id of active_record, then david would be saved.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>Added natural object-style assignment for has_many associations [Florian
            Weber]. Consider the following model:
            
            <pre>class Project &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  has_many :milestones&#x000A;end&#x000A;&#x000A;class Milestone &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  belongs_to :project&#x000A;end</pre>
            <p>
            Earlier, assignments would work like following regardless of which way the
            assignment told the best story:

            Now you can do it either from the belonging side:

            <pre>deadline.project = active_record</pre>
            <p>
            &#8230;or from the having side:
            </p>
            <pre>active_record.milestones &lt;&lt; deadline</pre>
            <p>
            The milestone is automatically saved with the new foreign key.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>API CHANGE: Attributes for text (or blob or similar) columns will now have
            unknown classes stored using YAML instead of using to_s. (Known classes
            that won&#8217;t be yamelized are: String, NilClass, TrueClass, FalseClass,
            <a href="../../../../classes/Fixnum.html">Fixnum</a>, Date, and Time).
            Likewise, data pulled out of text-based attributes will be attempted
            converged using Yaml if they have the &#8220;&#8212; &#8220; header. This
            was primarily done to be enable the storage of hashes and arrays without
            wrapping them in aggregations, so now you can do:
            
            <pre>user = User.find(1)&#x000A;user.preferences = { &quot;background&quot; =&gt; &quot;black&quot;, &quot;display&quot; =&gt; large }&#x000A;user.save&#x000A;&#x000A;User.find(1).preferences # =&gt; { &quot;background&quot; =&gt; &quot;black&quot;, &quot;display&quot; =&gt; large }</pre>
            <p>
            Please note that this method should only be used when you don&#8217;t care
            about representing the object in proper columns in the database. A money
            object consisting of an amount and a currency is still a much better fit
            for a value object done through aggregations than this new option.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>POSSIBLE CODE BREAKAGE: As a consequence of the lazy type conversions,
            it&#8217;s a bad idea to reference the @attributes hash directly (it always
            was, but now it&#8217;s paramount that you don&#8217;t). If you do, you
            won&#8217;t get the type conversion. So to implement new accessors for
            existing attributes, use read_attribute(attr_name) and
            write_attribute(attr_name, value) instead. Like this:
            
            <pre>class Song &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  # Uses an integer of seconds to hold the length of the song&#x000A;&#x000A;  def length=(minutes)&#x000A;    write_attribute(&quot;length&quot;, minutes * 60)&#x000A;  end&#x000A;&#x000A;  def length&#x000A;    read_attribute(&quot;length&quot;) / 60&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end</pre>
            <p>
            The clever kid will notice that this opens a door to sidestep the automated
            type conversion by using @attributes directly. This is not recommended as
            read/write_attribute may be granted additional responsibilities in the
            future, but if you think you know what you&#8217;re doing and aren&#8217;t
            afraid of future consequences, this is an option.

            <ul>
            <li>Added inheritable callback queues that can ensure that certain callback
            methods or inline fragments are run throughout the entire inheritance
            hierarchy. Regardless of whether a descendant overwrites the callback
            method:
            
            <pre>class Topic &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  before_destroy :destroy_author, 'puts &quot;I'm an inline fragment&quot;'&#x000A;end</pre>

            </li>
            <li>Added :dependent option to has_many and has_one, which will automatically
            destroy associated objects when the holder is destroyed:
            
            <pre>class Album &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  has_many :tracks, :dependent =&gt; true&#x000A;end</pre>
            <p>
            All the associated tracks are destroyed when the album is.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>Added Base.create as a factory that&#8217;ll create, save, and return a new
            object in one step.
            
            </li>
            <li>Automatically convert strings in config hashes to symbols for the
            _connection methods. This allows you to pass the argument hashes directly
            from yaml. (Luke)

            <li>Fixed the install.rb to include simple.rb [Spotted by Kevin Bullock]

            <li>Modified block syntax to better follow our code standards outlined in <a

            <li>Added object-level transactions [Austin Ziegler]
            
            </li>
            <li>Changed adapter-specific connection methods to use centralized <a
            href="../../../../classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#M002604">ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection</a>,
            which is parametized through a config hash with symbol keys instead of a
            regular parameter list. This will allow for database connections to be
            opened in a more generic fashion. (Luke)

            <li>Fixed SQLite adapter so objects fetched from has_and_belongs_to_many have
            proper attributes (t.name is now name). [Spotted by Garrett Rooney]

            <li>Fixed SQLite adapter so dates are returned as Date objects, not Time
            objects [Spotted by Gavin Sinclair]
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed requirement of date class, so date conversions are succesful
            regardless of whether you manually require date or not.

            <li>Changed Base.find to also accept either a list (1, 5, 6) or an array of ids
            ([5, 7]) as parameter and then return an array of objects instead of just
            an object
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed method has_collection? for has_and_belongs_to_many macro to behave as
            a collection, not an association
            
            </li>
            <li>Fixed SQLite adapter so empty or nil values in columns of datetime, date,
            or time type aren&#8217;t treated as current time [Spotted by Gavin
